    The food at Disneyland has to be one of the best parts about the park because its delicious. ðŸ˜‹ 
    <p> 
      My favorite food and snack to eat at Disneyland would be the pickles and churros. Persnoally I did think the macaronni at Galaxy's Eedge was good but the chicken felt very worked on. As if they added alot of sterioids to it. So i'd give it a 5/10. One thing i would say is the best dining experiance would be the Character dinning. I have gone multiple times and i always enjoyed it. The food is good too. I would say that the breakfast is better though because their waffles are delicious.

    <h3> 
      The Rides
   </h3> 
    <p>
      For the sake of space I will only be talking about rides from Magic Kingdom. The rides in Magic Kingdom are classics but also most of them are kind of boring. Dont get me wrong not all of them are boring but I would say the ones in Fantasyland are. EXCEPT the tea cup ride, that is the only excpetion. I would say the worst ride in Fantasyland, actually the worst rid ein the park, is the Matterhorn Bobsleds. That ride is straight up tramatizing. Everything about that ride is terrible, the painful seats, you get wet like c'mon, and the scary a** yedi animatronic. I will never get on that ride ever again.

    <h4>
      The Parks 
    </h4>
    <p>
      Not only is there Magic Kingdom but, theres also Californa Adventure (which I'd say is much more superior than MK). Both parks are fun but hwen goign into the fundementals of a theme park fit for a teenager, I'd say CA is the best choice.

      California has faster and more exciting rides like the incredicoaster, CARS, and a giant ferris wheel.
